Problem Statement : Program to find the modulo fo Fibonacci Series for nth number where n have 100000 digits given in binary.

solution : 

Take n in array of integer size 100000 then generate the random binary number using Random Class.
Now problem is to find the n is even or odd.
To find even or odd we have simply check mark our index = len-1 
if index is 0 then it is even
if index is 1 then it is odd
now decrement the index till 0.
