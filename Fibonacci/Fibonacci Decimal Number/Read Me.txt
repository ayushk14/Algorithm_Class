Problem Statement : Program to find the modulo fo Fibonacci Series for nth number where n have 100000 digits given in decimal.

solution : 

Take n in array of integer size 100000.
Now problem is to find the n is even or odd.
To find even or odd we have written divideby2 function
This Function basically divide the number stored in array and return the number of 0's left in it.
if the number of 0's in array ==  length of array then our program terminates.
